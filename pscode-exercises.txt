// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(
A: 1

b: 2

a+b == ab
)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(
IF ab/2, then print "Even"

ELSE print "Odd"
)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(
a) Read in 5 separate numbers: 

a==1
b==2
c==3
d==4
e==5

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers:
To find the average == sum(a+b+c+d+e)/5 
To display the answer print "Average == (display number)"


c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers:
IF a/b/c/d/e<1, 
THEN print "Minimum number == (display number)"

IF a/b/c/d/e>5,
THEN print "Maximum number == (display number)"

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
Average is the value that best represent the data set
Minimum is the least/smallest number of the set of integers
Maximum is the greatest number of the set of integers
